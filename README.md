# hosted-ttt

This game of tic-tac-toe will start up a [javaserver](https://github.com/Akcbryant/javaserver "github.com/Akcbryant/javaserver") on port 5000. At this point you can navigate to localhost:5000
and have a go at some tic-tac-toe!

The tic-tac-toe uses minimax to play against you. You can check it out [here](https://github.com/Akcbryant/clojure-ttt "github.com/Akcbryant/clojure-ttt").

## Usage

Make sure you have [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/) installed!

Grab this project, navigate to its directory, and use ```lein run``` to start up the server.

Navigate to localhost:5000 and there you have it!

```Lein test``` will run all of the tests as well!
